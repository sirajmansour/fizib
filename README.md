The code is pretty bad. Literally potato.
This repo is temporarily available and will get deleted soon the errors are fixed.
This repo is very similiare to https://github.com/promiselb/a-try-to-make-a-website-database but with frontend support 20% completed.

The main issue is hosting the signUp page won't run the JS file with it. Which's illogical because JS front end has ran in other examples with the same logic.

The the javascript code is from https://github.com/rrrCode9/Golang-web-server---Javascript-HTML---HTTP-Communication/tree/master/src where there's a full working example of go-js communication.
